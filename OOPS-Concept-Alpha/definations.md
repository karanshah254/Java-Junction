1. Encapsulation
- >It is defined as wrapping up data and methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding.

2. Constructors:
- >It is special method which is invoked automatically at time of object creation. it has same name as class name. They are called once, at object creation.

3. Destructors:
- >In Java, we have garbage collector which automatically deletes the objects when not in used. So there are no destructors in Java.

4. Inheritance:
- >inheritance is when properties of parent class are passed on to child class.
- >Types of inheritance: Single-Level, Multi-Level, Hierarchial, hybrid.

5. Polymorphism:
- >Compile Time Polymorphism: Method Overloading (Static)
- >Run Time Polymorphism: Method Overriding (Dynamic)

6. Package:
- >Package is a group of similar type of classes, interfaces, and sub packages. 
- >Types: In-built and User-defined

7. Abstraction:
- >Hiding all the unnecessary details and showing only the important parts to user. These are implemented using Abstract classes & Interfaces.
- >Properties of Abstract Class: 
- >1. Cannot create an instance of abstract class.
- >2. Can have abstract/non-abstract methods.
- >3. Can have constructors.

8. Interface:
- >Interface is blue-print of the class. It is basically for multiple-inheritance. It has total abstraction. All methods are publc, abstract and without implementation.

9. static keyword:
- >It is used to share the same variable and method of given class. It can be used for properties, functions, blocks, nested classes.

10. super keyword:
- >It is used to refer immediate parent class object. It is used to access parents properties, functions, constructors.
