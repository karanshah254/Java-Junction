| Method | Description |
| Math.abs() | It will return the Absolute value of the given value. |
| Math.max() | It returns the Largest of two values. |
| Math.min() | It is used to return the Smallest of two values. |
| Math.round() | It is used to round of the decimal numbers to the nearest value. |
| Math.sqrt() | It is used to return the square root of a number. |
| Math.cbrt() | It is used to return the cube root of a number. |
| Math.pow() | It returns the value of first argument raised to the power to second argument.|
| Math.signum() | It is used to find the sign of a given value. |
| Math.ceil() | It is used to find the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to the argument or mathematical integer. |
| Math.copySign() | It is used to find the Absolute value of first argument along with sign specified in second argument. |
| Math.nextAfter() | It is used to return the floating-point number adjacent to the first argument in the direction of the second argument. |
| Math.nextUp() | It returns the floating-point value adjacent to d in the direction of positive infinity. |
| Math.nextDown() | It returns the floating-point value adjacent to d in the direction of negative infinity. |
| Math.floor() | It is used to find the largest integer value which is less than or equal to the argument and is equal to the mathematical integer of a double value. |
| Math.floorDiv() | It is used to find the largest integer value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient. |
| Math.random() | It returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. |
| Math.rint() | It returns the double value that is closest to the given argument and equal to mathematical integer. |
| Math.hypot() | It returns sqrt(x2 +y2) without intermediate overflow or underflow. |
| Math.ulp() | It returns the size of an ulp of the argument. |
| Math.getExponent() | It is used to return the unbiased exponent used in the representation of a value. |
| Math.IEEEremainder() | It is used to calculate the remainder operation on two arguments as prescribed by the IEEE 754 standard and returns value. |
| Math.addExact() | It is used to return the sum of its arguments, throwing an exception if the result overflows an int or long. |
